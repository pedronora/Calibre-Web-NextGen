"""Regression pin for fork issue #799: the new UI's Help menu "Report Issue on
GitHub" link opened the blank-issue form (``/issues/new``) instead of the
template chooser, so reporters landed on an empty textarea instead of the
Bug report / Feature request forms defined in ``.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/``.

The fix points the link at ``/issues/new/choose`` (adopts @chloeroform's #800).
This pin keeps the chooser URL in place so a future refactor can't silently
revert to the bare ``/issues/new`` form.
