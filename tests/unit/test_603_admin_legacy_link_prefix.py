"""Regression tests for #603 — the tail of #571.

Behind a sub-path reverse proxy (app mounted at https://host/cwa/), the new UI's
Admin page rendered its "More server configuration" cards as raw
``<a href="/admin/config">`` etc. — root-absolute legacy paths that skipped the
reverse-proxy prefix helper #571 wired into the rest of the app. So a card that
should point at ``/cwa/admin/config`` pointed at the domain root, landing outside
the mount (404 / breaks out of the app). Reporter @chloeroform pinned the exact
line (Admin.tsx server-config map).

The fix routes those hrefs through ``resourceUrl()`` — the single-source-of-truth
prefix helper in api.ts (idempotent, leaves external/data URLs untouched, and a
no-op when the mount prefix is empty, so root-mount installs are unaffected).

Client-side source pins (the SPA bundle is built in Docker, not committed, so a
runtime assertion isn't reachable here — pin the source that the build compiles).
The audit-around-the-ask siblings (OAuth buttons, the 404 fallback) are pinned
too so the same gap can't reopen next door.
