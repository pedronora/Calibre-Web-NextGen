"""Pin the privilege-drop contract for ``cover_enforcer.py``.

Context — the May-13 s6 privilege-drop audit
(`notes/s6-privilege-drop-audit.md`, autopilot-side):

`metadata-change-detector/run` runs ``cover_enforcer.py`` as root by
design (since fork #802 via the ``metadata_change_dispatch.py``
debouncer, which itself runs as root and invokes the enforcer — the
privilege model is unchanged, only the invocation is indirected).
``cover_enforcer`` shells out to ``calibredb`` /
``ebook-polish`` to edit the on-disk Calibre tree, then explicitly
``os.chown(book_dir, uid, gid)`` back to PUID:PGID so the Flask app
(which runs as ``abc``) keeps write access to the same files.

If a future contributor either:

* removes the chown helper (assuming "the service drops privileges
  elsewhere now"), or
* changes the chown to skip files (e.g. forgets to walk subdirectories),

the user-visible symptom is silent — Flask just starts failing
cover-from-URL saves and metadata embeds with permission denied. This
test pins the helper's existence and the env-driven chown shape so
that regression goes red at unit-test time, long before anyone
notices the broken cover save in production.

The pin is intentionally structural (existence of method + AST shape
of its body), not behavioral. Behavioral testing of root→chown
requires running as root, which the test runner doesn't do.
