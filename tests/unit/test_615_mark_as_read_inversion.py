"""Regression tests for #615 — "Mark as read" translated with the *unread* sense.

French (and 16 other locales) translated the lowercase msgid "Mark as read"
identically to "Mark as unread" (fr: both "Marquer comme non lu"). The new UI
uses exactly this msgid pair (BookDetail action button / aria-label), so an
unread book offered "Marquer comme non lu". The classic detail page uses the
title-case pair "Mark As Read"/"Mark As Unread", which is translated correctly
everywhere — that pair is the donor for the fix.

Second symptom on the same page: the classic detail read CTA reused the
read-*status* msgid "Read" (fr "Lu", a past participle) as a verb button.
It now uses the verb msgid "Read now" introduced for the SPA by #577, so the
status translations ("Lu", "Gelezen", …) stay untouched where they are correct
(cover badges, listenmp3 checkbox label).
