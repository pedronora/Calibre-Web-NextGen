"""Pin the version-defining build ARGs to GLOBAL scope (before the first FROM).

A Dockerfile `ARG FOO` re-declared inside a build stage only inherits a
default value when FOO is a *global* arg — one declared before the first
`FROM`. If the defaulted declaration sits inside an earlier stage, the
re-declaration in a later stage resolves to the empty string.

That is exactly what broke every :dev image build on 2026-06-28: commit
c1cd7b462 prepended a `FROM node:22-slim AS frontend-build` stage above the
ARG block, which had been global until then. CALIBRE_RELEASE / KEPUBIFY_RELEASE
/ PYTHON_VERSION / PYTHON_BUILD_STANDALONE_RELEASE became scoped to
frontend-build, so the `dependencies` stage re-declared them empty. The
download steps then built malformed URLs such as

    https://github.com/pgaskin/kepubify/releases/download//kepubify-linux-64bit

(note the `download//kepubify` — empty release), which 404s. Bumping the pin
(#544), adding retries (#545/#550) and authenticating the download (#546) all
chased the wrong layer because the URL itself was malformed. #549 hoisted the
PYTHON_* pins (and moved Python to a GHCR mirror) but left CALIBRE_RELEASE /
KEPUBIFY_RELEASE trapped in the frontend-build stage, so the build advanced
past Python and died at the kepubify download instead.

These tests fail on the broken layout (defaults trapped after the first FROM)
and pass once the defaults are hoisted above every FROM. They also guard
against a future stage being prepended above the ARG block again.
